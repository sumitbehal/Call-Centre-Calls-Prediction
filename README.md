# Call-Centre-Calls-Prediction
Customers have high expectations for the customer service provided by brands. They not only want their issues addressed, they want them handled quickly and efficiently. When a time-sensitive matter arises, customers often turn first to the telephone. According to a report from Forrester Research in 2013, the phone is the most frequently used communication channel for service, with 73% of customers using the phone for customer service. This is a higher percentage than online channels, such as email and chat.

It’s critical that when customers call for service or support, a representative is available. Brands that utilize call centers can effectively provide assistance to customers in need. Call centers can make a brand available 24x7, or during a time window that matches customers’ expectations.

In addition to servicing customers’ needs, phone calls handled by call centers are valuable touchpoints with customers. With some products or services, phone calls are the only interaction that brands have with their customers.

This project is here to predict number of calls for everyday so that company can be on alert during the peak days..
